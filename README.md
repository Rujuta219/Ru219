ATTPCROOT is a ROOT-based (root.cern.ch) framework to analyze data of the ATTPC detector (Active Target Time Projection Chamber) and the p-ATTPC (Prototype). 
For reference http://ribf.riken.jp/ARIS2014/slide/files/Jun2/Par2B06Bazin-final.pdf. The detector is based at the NSCL but experiments are performed at other facilities as well (Notre Dame, TRIUMF, Argonne...). 
The framework allows the end user to unpack and analyze the data, as well as perform realistic simulations based on a Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) package. 
The framework needs external libraries (FairSoft and FairRoot https://fairroot.gsi.de/) to be compiled and executed, which are developed by other groups and not directly supported by the AT-TPC group. Please refer to their forums for installation issues of these packages.
 A detector tailored to low energy reactions
Active gas target and full 4Ï€ angular coverage High luminosity without loss of resolution Beam slowing in gas gives excitation function
Requirements and restrictions
Target gas has to provide good electron amplification (mixtures) Trigger generation: slowing down beam particle ionize the gas Time projection chamber is slow (rate limitation)
 Solid targets provide poor luminosity
Inverse kinematics reactions in solid targets (probe) Target-like particle has little energy to leave target material
Compromise between resolution and number of nuclei in target (resolution goes against luminosity)
ATTPC Concept : Tilt relative to beam axis to increase accuracy for small angles
Active Target TPC gets us high intensity and low energy beam to produce high resolution results.
